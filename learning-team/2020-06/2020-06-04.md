### replacing `ember-ref-modifier` (@chriskrycho  - CK)

One of the advanced examples in the guides, [Communicating Between Elements in
a Component][example], uses `ember-ref-modifier` to show how to implement some
custom functionality. This example dates to a time before the existence of
`ember-modifier`, and was reasonable to include at the time. However, today the
example can be implemented much more cleanly using a class-based modifier from
`ember-modifier`. Just as importantly, using `ref` has significant performance
implications that are *not* obvious: it requires two rendering passes. I’ve had
to wave people off of using `ref` a couple times already in our app as we adopt
Octane, because it’s officially recommended in the Guides, which we point people
to as our *first* source of truth for how to write Octane. I suggest we remove
it in favor of another example using one of the `ember-modifier` variants.

- Alternate suggestion by @jrjohnson, CK has comments on this will mention at the meeting: https://github.com/emberjs/core-notes/pull/306#issuecomment-632801292

### Ember CLI API docs (from @mehulkar, who may or may not attend - 10mins)

I want to get an update on getting API docs on `https://api.emberjs.com/ember-cli`
and redirecting `ember-cli.com/api`. As embroider approaches and the larger
JS community experiments with JS development (e.g. Snowpack), it is
important for the Ember project to _enable_ its community to experiment also.
Moving the API docs to the main site will make it easier to improve
documentation, add examples, and propose API improvements that can
enable such experimentation.

### Future plans for Ember Octane vs. Classic Cheat Sheet (@ijlee2, 5-10 min)

The project is now an Octane app. What further developments would we like to see happen?

I would like to work on updating CI (upgrade workflow actions to `v2` + introduce Percy) and look into if we need more tests to help contributors feel confident in making changes.

Luke Melia provided suggestions for additional topics in two issues: ([#36](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-octane-vs-classic-cheat-sheet/issues/36) and [#37](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-octane-vs-classic-cheat-sheet/issues/37)). Would these topics be a good addition to the cheat sheet?

### Titles  in "Octane Upgrade Guide" (RM, 10min)
- https://guides.emberjs.com/release/upgrading/current-edition/
>  The titles are named after the target API instead of the thing you want to upgrade from, which makes finding relevant information tricky.

## Weekly review

## Topics

### ember.js.org splash page (NVP, 10min)
Following the discussion [in a js-org issue](https://github.com/js-org/js.org/pull/6789#issuecomment-1008952693) and a brief discussion in Discord, NVP drafted this splash page https://nullvoxpopuli.github.io/ember-js-org/.
Prior art:
- https://node.js.org/
- https://vue.js.org/
Pros:
- We control the slash page project (NVP would transfer if we go ahead)
- `js.org` is quite popular in the JS community
- We still funnel visitors to the official website

### Tailwind appendix to Ember CLI Guides (NVP, JW, ?min)
PR: https://github.com/ember-learn/cli-guides/pull/245

### review team handbook (RM, 5min)
I think we should come up with a simple plan and cadence to review our non-programming resources.
To start, I suggest updating the [Team Leadership](https://github.com/ember-learn/handbook/blob/main/team-leadership.md) page of hour handbook.
I was checking the repo for other reasons and upon reading that particular page found it quite outdated.
Desired outcomes:
- Simple plan for cadence

### improve search across sub-sites (API, Guides, Deprecations, etc) (RM, xx min)

- All search experiences are fragmented with varying degrees of results.

### what is a release (RM, xx min)

- The concept of a release. We have a concept of project release. We should make
sure we are all in sync and figure out next steps to communicate with other
core teams and the community.

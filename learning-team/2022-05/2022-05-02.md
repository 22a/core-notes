### Goals brainstorming

Unstructured, no decisions to make here. What do we want the experience to be
for learning Ember? This is a meta conversation like we used to do for
face-to-face meetings. The eventual outcome would be to refine the list
to have some high level goals we can use to inform our decision making
about what to prioritize.

### TypeScript in the docs (see previous week's notes)
Continuing the conversation, from where we left off from previous weeks:

The TS team wants to introduce TS into learning resources:

- A toggle for code samples, which could impact prose. Could be a
full website toggle or a per-code-sample toggle.
- Take content from docs.ember-cli-typescript.com and incorporate into the
guides

## Topics

### Point of order: should we be more strict on agenda items’ time <@mansona>

- yes let's identify a time keeper every week too

### Can the “core team” get merge permissions to embroider-build/embroider and ember-auto-import please <@mansona>

- enable branch protections and then add people to a team


### Discuss methods to “book” pairing sessions (review last week’s “decision”) - also should the standing agenda item be the first item because we never get around to it <@mansona>

- we can try a booking system and see if it works
- (discuss the "decisions from last week")
- EF: the high leverage stuff here is to not teach you how the code works but instead teaching you how to figure out how the code works.
- we could set the 2 hours before this call for pairing time
- this call is really the status update and we would have a real office hours 

### https://github.com/ember-template-imports/ember-template-imports/pull/146 <@nullvoxpopuli>

- EF: PR looks good but I don't have merge commits
- there is a more general effort to collect the repos that are "blessed" and make sure that the right people have merge commits
- i've added this to the framework meeting notes to be discussed (even though I'm not there)
- actually we should probably add it to https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/871
- I added a checkbox
- aside: I'm working on a swc parser to do the preprocessor: https://github.com/ef4/swc/tree/glimmer


### https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1383, relates to: ensure-safe-component isssue <@NullVoxPopuli>

- EF: really people shouldn't be using ensure-safe-component but there are a few places that it makes sense
- CM: maybe that should be a recommended lint rule?
- EF: yea probably
- SI: this wouldn't be a problem if strict mode was working correctly (hence the PR)
- EF: looks good, merged

### https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1388 <@NullVoxPopuli>

- deferred because of a tight timeline 

### manually runnable workflows? https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1392 <@NullVoxPopuli>

- CM: I didn't understand this
- EF: gives us a button to run the deploy 
- seems good - merged

### do we care about backfilling changelog entries atm? https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1360 (Changelogs until  Feb 14) <@NullVoxPopuli>

- deferred to discuss with Preston

### Review of Glint Registry for Macros: https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1354 <@NullVoxPopuli>

- (reviewing the PR)
- CM: it seems odd that there are no type checks in this PR
- we discussed this last week but I would feel uncomforable merging something like this without the safety net of a test
- EF: this can't actually break anything because it requires you to import a new thing
- added a review

### Should the embroider team be admins of the embroider github org? <@mansona>

- yes and done
- and we moved ember-auto-import

### review/merge https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1391 <@void_mAlex>

- reviewed and commented on it

### Is it time to release? <@mansona>

- EF: yes but probably not before I go on vacation
- we have some work to do - document breaking changes and upgrade paths
- CM: we should discuss this in the next meeting that you are here
- A: can we ping you before the next meeting (but after you are back)
- EF: you can ping me on Friday 21st

### talk about the feasibility of some router ideas for exposing loading templates as a high priority download and parse based on a convention of exporting a named constant from templates imported and used in router.js; some extra context and pseudo code examples here <@void_mAlex>

- https://gist.github.com/void-mAlex/e9a73e77ad12668eade751bf6a8121be
- (long discussion)
- (no notes taken on this one)


### Standing agenda item: Who is working on what tasks and do you need help with context?

- CM: I discussed this with AC and we think this should go at the top of the list because we never quite get around to this standing item
- EF: yep that sounds good, as long as the item generates agenda items and doesn't go over time

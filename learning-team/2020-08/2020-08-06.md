### Reorganizing `Built-In Components` in Ember Guides (IL, 10-15 min)

  - https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/blob/master/packages/%40ember/-internals/glimmer/lib/templates/input.hbs (used by `<Input>` component)
  - https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/blob/master/packages/%40ember/-internals/glimmer/lib/templates/component.hbs (used by `<Textarea>` component)

It wasn't clear to the issuer that event handling for built-in `<Input>` component needs to be different for checkbox and non-checkbox inputs. Our checkbox examples show first and last names (not the best example of a checkbox).

Proposed todos:

- Rename the section from `Built-In Components` to `Input Components`
- Divide the section into 2 subsections: native inputs and built-in inputs
- The built-in inputs subsection has 3 sub-subsections: non-checkbox input, checkbox input, and textarea.
- Check that the event names are correct for the built-in non-checkbox and checkbox input components

    - anecdotally, I get DMs about "where is the core team, I can't get ahold of anyone"

- (public) Template compilation performance regression 3.25+ (RJ)
    - In a large internal application, the overall build speed regressed by 10% (45s) when upgrading from ember-source@3.24 to ember-source@3.28
    - CPU Profile shows a few interesting things
        - ~ 13s spent in GC on 3.28 (vs ~ 500ms in 3.24)
        - the new HbsSpan/Loc generation accounts for another ~ 7s

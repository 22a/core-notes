<!-- ### Your topic (INITIALS, expected duration in minutes) -->

### move to deprecate dockerized-ember (CM, 2mins)

https://github.com/ember-learn/dockerized-ember is not being used any more for the website development and I think we should deprecated it

### Release dates in the website (JW?, 15mins)

There was a long discussion about the release pages being consistantly wrong on Discord, we should discuss it in the meeting :+1:

### Status update on Octane cheatsheet (IL, 5 min)

- `@bartocc` has been helping out with translation to French. App structure (`/snippets` and `/translations` folders) has been updated to help multiple people work on translation.
- App uses Ember v3.19. Dependencies will continued to be updated now and then.
- Percy was added. I did notice that a recent PR (https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-octane-vs-classic-cheat-sheet/pull/48) that came from a forked repo did not run Percy check. I hope to look at addressing this problem next.

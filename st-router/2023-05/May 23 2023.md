## Agenda

- Lots of questions to answer
- Maybe start a path-to-mvp doc


## Notes

Everything is a resource...except routes. So let's talk about it.

1. the lifetime of the route isn‚Äôt what you think it is; you could register a destructor but it wouldn‚Äôt run until the every end of the program being torn down. üò¨
2. you‚Äôd have to use the `activate` and `deactivate` API to get the functionality you think an event listener + destructor would give you
3. why? well, it‚Äôs just old and it came first. 
4. https://youtu.be/sWGyJR6P-V0?t=912 ‚Äúcorrectly the template for the old route they left has now ended its lifetime, but incorrectly, the route for that route they have left is still alive‚Äù
5. active parent routes and templates stay alive

we should be taking the routes and make them match their template lifetimes. 
When we transition to another model on the same route, nothing happens with the lifetimes, **but we think it should.**
If we did this, then that register destructor pattern would work and routes would be composable with the rest of the system.

### Goals

1. Routes and their templates should BOTH have useful timelines (right now only templates do, and only in most cases)
2. Unified data loading experience. Let routes expose resources to handle data loading
    1. the resources themselves only have access to the params
    2. the lifetime of the route becomes scoped to one model and anytime you‚Äôre changing the route you‚Äôre getting a fresh resource (which only has access to the params), it‚Äôs gotta produce a model
    3. this would mean everything runs the same way every time
    4. it would also mean we could get parallel loading in nested routes
3. Change the router primitives so they use `@glimmer/tracking` and `@ember/destroyable`
    1. The router itself becomes yet another resource
    2. create `TrackedURL` that is a spec-compliant implementation of `URL` that is observable by the reactivity system (just like we have `TrackedMap` that is a spec-compliant implementation of `Map` )
        1. MI: we should basically be able to run the spec test suite against the implementation of this
        2. MI: I think the goal was to say we could replace the built-in 
            1. (`window.location` IS the URL)
4. Also accessible routing



### Problem

Problem: the lifetime of a template of a route extends while you‚Äôre in any number of different models on the same route; this was done intentionally as a rendering optimization back when rendering was expensive. 

### Evidence

1. you‚Äôll notice code in components where people are manually trying to clean them up when models change
2. they add observers, render modifiers, all trying to get things back into a ‚Äúclean‚Äù state

these are symptoms that the lifetime was wrong & what you need is a fresh instance of a component

You *could* get this functionality today with stable public API:

This works because the `each` helper has a sense of identity. As it‚Äôs going through a list of things to render, it will `===` check and if so, it will re-use the block (and if it‚Äôs not, it won‚Äôt)


## Data Loading/Models today

### Problem: When do model hooks run confusion

The model hook on a route that loads all of your data‚Ä¶If you transition into a route via the ID/args/params you will run the model hook to load the model but you can also pass an *existing* model to the `transitionTo` and then the model hook doesn‚Äôt run. 

> ‚ÄúMega troll and confusing.‚Äù 

This is why we have needed a `beforeModel` and `afterModel` distinct from the model hook, because those *do* always run and the model hook does not.

CT: suspect this has more to do with fetching (you could redirect them if, say, they‚Äôre not authorized)

CT: consider the pattern of putting in a nice URL and it updates to use something like a :slug or id

Now this was designed intentionally for caching! 

We wanted to be able to link directly to it and avoid loading it again.

Also rendering used to be expensive.

TEACHING: if you want that caching behavior, you build it into the resource, it doesn‚Äôt come by default. 

### Problem: Synchronous data loading

Right now each route has synchronous access to its ancestors‚Äô models 

So the parent loads and then the child and then the grandchild etc

So everyone has to wait their turn, even if it doesn‚Äôt *need* to do this (serialization) 

And can‚Äôt be loaded in parallel 

### Solution: Flexibility

The idea here is that routes could still have synchronous access to their ancestors‚Äôs resources

but resources are constructed synchronously (so they are there right away)

and *if* you want something from that resource, your own resources can compose with them

so you can wait for them if you need to but not if you don‚Äôt.

Parallelize where it makes sense, still enforce serialization where it makes sense. 

Example, you still want serialization if a parent check needs to do an auth check before moving to a child route

### Problem: Query Params

- can only keep their state on controllers (and this is Ember‚Äôs last feature to actually *need* controllers)
- sometimes trigger transitions, sometimes don‚Äôt (`refreshModel`)
- sometimes append to browser history, sometimes don‚Äôt (`replace`)
- implicitly get serialization/deserialization based off their default values
    - ‚Äúthey guess‚Äù
    - MI: arrays get weird
    - CT: there is an API but it‚Äôs not widely used (also there‚Äôs a lot of footguns there)
        - some of it is the type inference
        - they‚Äôre not name-spaced by default
            - MS: seems like a bug
        - CT: look for the query params experiment (will link)
        - AM: could we improve DX here with messages if we can detect that QP‚Äôs are coming from different places? (explicitly a dev mode)
        - Look at the tracked-params new addon (by Ed) (link)
- sticky by default but can be manually scoped
- API lives on *both* controller and route
    - SS: obvs the goal is to remove the controller
    - AM: we shouldn‚Äôt be depending on controllers at all because they are singletons
    - CT: encourage asking instead ‚Äúshould the state or the config live in either controller or route AT ALL‚Äù
        - AM: config of what?
        - CT: the config of how you go from some key/value pair to the URL and vice-versa
        - CT: IMO this should be able to be dynamic
    - AM: think of a tracked QP as a tracked object maybe?
- the source (QP) is both an **output** but also an **input**
    - they are an output because we want them to auto-update when state changes
    - but they are also input because they need to re-init your state from the URL
        - at the start of the appropriate lifetime
        - and when the URL bar is manually changed by the user

now, compare this to dynamic route segments. They‚Äôre mostly only inputs, you change them by transitioning, you don‚Äôt have some field that you set (that has the side effect of changing the URL)

CT: you can‚Äôt hit the back button if you use `replaceState`

you don‚Äôt want a full transition when you‚Äôre just trying to reflect saving what the user is doing, like a search term (maybe saving the search term saved in a query param in the URL, you don‚Äôt want each character of the search to be in the history)

## Questions:

1. have we reviewed SvelteKit‚Äôs router?
2. what about SSR?

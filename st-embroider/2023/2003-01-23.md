<5 min> (?) recommended solution for consuming (production) assets from v1 addons <@22a>

  - a few things that we can do now
  - asset rev should be avoided
  - right now we need to opt into some things in webpack config
  - least bad thing is for an app to decide for certain file types
    - if an app tries to import something from an addon the app needs the config
    - if an addon needs to import something then it need to tell the app to add the config (manual step)
    - we need an RFC to cover what we can support for the long term
  - ember-auto-import can be used as a "gradual upgrade to embroider" for this funcationality
    - the webpack config can cover the types of files you care about
    - in a plain npm package it already works
    - in a v2 addon it already works
    - tricker case is v1 addons (it knows that there is odd stuff going on)
    - it also won't do anything with assets in the app
    - the assumption is that there are "classic ways" that the assets are getting included, if ember-auto-import also dealt with them there would be duplicates 
  - there should be a way (config) to include your app in the ember-auto-import work
    - e.g. you could have a particular folder that is just "normal js"
  - one problem of classic app format is that `app/` is the entry point for everythign so you can't import anything outside it
  - 22a: should we just upgrade our addons to v2 or do we need to invent this new config?
  - ef4: yes probably, but this is still useful
  - the actual config option would be to put a subdirectory of app under the remit of ember-auto-import
  - not a super hard implementation, but we would need to make sure that the classic build would not see it
    - use broccoli funnel to remove it
  - it should be straightforward if we force people to be explicit in their config
  - it all gets handled in the same way that 3rd party stuff would get handled
  - you would probably need to rename relative imports to be the fully resolved `your-app-name/thing`
    - i.e. ember-auto-import would do this automatically
  - this could even allow you to progressivly move to embroider one folder at a time from a classic build


<5 min> (?) recommended approach for inline svgs <@22a>
  - similar converation to the last one
  - CM: there are conversation happening in addons e.g. ember responsive image that help us think about things differently
  - CM: I think there is a conversation in the svg jar addon but I'm not sure
  - EF: you could convert all SVGs to components, but you could also implement a simple loader for svgs

<15 min> discuss next steps of https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1321 <@void_mAlex>
  - is this essentially done?
  - A: yes... mostly... there are some reviews that still need to happen
  - A: (some details about specific commits that need extra review)
  - A: should we merge it with any skipped tests?
  - EF: we can land it with some skipped tests since it's so much better
  - EF: as long as we're not submitting any tests that are passing with wrong semantics
  - if there are we can make them fail and then skip them and come back to them
  - A: I would love to dig more into one of the tests if we have time today
  - EF: might get back to it if we have time

<10 min>  last weeks topics
- thoughts/decision on https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/1330 <@simon>

  - SI: this all depends on the lock step strategy we have for embroider
  - (discussion about the benefits of this approach)
  - EF: we could just implement this using the existing ember-source-channel-url
  - this would prevent more infra
  - SI: maybe we merge the carrat PR
  - EF: yes! merged
  - we should try to implement the the source channel thing upstream. Anyone who wants to take it

<10-15min> empty @ember/test-helpers dependency in the embroider output <@mansona>
  - sorry I was talking and couldn't take notes ðŸ™ˆ
  - rough conclusion: the issue is likely in build-compat-addons.ts and related to "smooshing"
  - there is a part that is outputing an empty package, this is a good time to drop a debugger and watching the code work
  - EF: this is all likely going to go away when we move to a resolver implementation of embroider (instead of the heavy-handed copy whole tree implementation)
  - 
<10-15min> Unblock v2 conversion of ember-responsive-image: <@simon>
https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/1305 
  - opt into new format for index.html with a flag
  - a bit vague and I need to give more details
https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import/issues/554 (Importing assets with query params does not work)
  - it's likely the embroider-auto-import splitter that needs a change
  - the define is being driven by data that is coming out of the splitter
  - you will likely need to add the correct implementation to the `webpack.ts` entryTemplate
  - in the issue there is a missing define, the define example in the issue is showing it as a consumer so something is going to need to define what 
  - (discussion about other odd things in the build - a bit of investigation)
  - slightly trolly thing: you need to add webpack config to autoImport **and** the embroider config in your ember-auto-import
  - if we want to allow people to import things from their own app in ember-auto-import then we will need to implement the first feature we discussed today
  - re: trolly webpack config there are a few options that we can do. open to suggestions to make it better
<5m> should ember-auto-import be under the embroider org? (related to release conversation and bus number) <@mansona>
  - maybe
  - CM: this is about allowing more peopel to release the important things
  - EF: sure sounds good
  - EF: we could move it to the embroider monorepo
  - CM: I wasn't suggesting that ðŸ™ˆ
<2m> ember-cli-babel v8 https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1334 <@nullvoxpopuli>
  - (discussion about the new semantics of ember-cli-babel)
  - consensus: let's just merge this
  - (more discussion)
  - CM: let's comment the changes and we can get this in the next release. Releasing is more urgent
  - EF: sure

Do a release
  - CM: can we record it
  - EF: probably written is better
  - CM: I will do that with the notes


  process: 
    - I look at the changelog and find the release name
    - find the corresponding tag
    - I look at the git log and search for "Merge pull" and make sure that all pull requests are covered
    - (trying to remember changesets)
   
    - asside there is a lot of manual work
    - NVP: that's because we forgot to add changeset to PRS before merging
    - CM: can't make that the PR authors job, and can't put it on the maintainer
    - EF: I need a list of all changes per package so we know what packages need to be released
    - EF: with a monorepo that we have we don't want per-package changelogs
    - the big thing is that it can't generate the changelog for me
    - reference: there is a quest issue about this
    
    - create the new release in the markdown

    ```
    # Release 2022-11-30.0
    ```

    - multi pass process

    - get PR 
    - find what files/packages changed - > ad a header for the package and if it is a patch/minor/major
    - add pr under the header

    ```
    ## `@embroider/compat`, `@embroider/core`, `@embroider/test-setup`, `@embroider/webpack` patch

    - BUGFIX: detect ember-template-compliation plugin correctly when other plugins are preventing parallelization [1299](https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1299)
    ```

    - I'm going to keep these alphabetical by package

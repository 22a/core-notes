## Topics

### EmberData ember-cli-addon-docs PRs (CM, 10m)

- CM: quick summary of situation - prs from runspired to fix a bug
- CM: I don't know if I have the context to feel confident merging any of these
- AG: should we wait for Jen on this one?
- CM: we could, but she might not be back next week. 
- and there is a potential urgent cliff here since it's release week and the next major (in 6 weeks) will be Ember 5.0 and there are big changes
- CM: I'll reach out and see what the urgency is and see if runspired is free to pair with one of team to get these merged

### Website redesign update (CM, 10m)

- CM: ci is back working for styleguide, guidemaker-ember-template, and the website-redesign branch of guides-source
- I needed to update Node to v14 on Netlify so that percy would keep building
- we need to baby-sit the next merge to master on guides-source to make sure the netlify build is still working üëç
- new preview link is updated: https://deploy-preview-1717--ember-guides.netlify.app/release/

### Release week (JG, 5m)

- I'll be helping runspired with the EmberData release so it makes sense for me to write up that bit
- AG: happy for you to do it
- CM: [no comment]

## Topics

### Update Learning Event

- upon starting the meeting today we realized that the time for the learning team meeting is in correct, but we don't have perms to change things
- we've ping'ed the relevant people to update the time of the event so that we can use the events channel and the community is better notified of the meeting next week

### API Docs home page (AG, 5min)

- moving this to next week when AG is back

### (New) Menu Items
https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-styleguide/pull/477#pullrequestreview-1549891733

- CM we probably don't want this as a top level menu item
- CM we need to find a place for this, but it's not clear where it should live
- CM perhaps the Docs menu and the quickstart
- RM it's unclear if the tutorial would run in stackblitz so we'd need to verify that this works before adding it there
- RM we can improve the default experience of ember new or improve the current stackblitz experience, either way we will need to maintain it
- CM need a better onboarding experience if we're going to add this to the header menu, but no objection to adding this to the quickstart or tutorial
- RM could add it to quickstart today and ask someone to help with the tutorial
- We left a review and indicated this would be best in the quickstart and opened issue re the same https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/issues/1951

### Netlify Error 404 (RM)

- RM if you got to a non-existent route on most of our resources you get a netlify 404 and not our 404, this is due to a redirect issue
- CM this is a side-effect of prember things
- CM we need to update this: https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/blob/master/.netlifyredirects
- CM created this https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/1952, but we need to test it before we do anything
- RM we need to check all of the websites for this issue too

### Different versions for documentation with EmberData doing minimum LTS versions

- We'll talk more about this next week

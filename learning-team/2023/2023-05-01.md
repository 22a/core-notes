- Blog post help if you can. Edits welcome https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-blog/pull/1273

### API docs

Still troubleshooting to see what's up with v2 on the published site.

### Broken links for Ember Data API docs

Some links to source code have `packages/packages` in the URL, which is incorrect.
We have volunteers but they need more guidance from us to fix this.

Where in the pipeline does this link get generated?
- It's not hard coded in the source code https://github.com/emberjs/data/blob/v4.10.0/packages/store/addon/-private/record-arrays/identifier-array.ts#L118
- It could be influenced by the `@module` or other yuidoc tag structure
- The API response with the JSON has `../packages/store/addon/-private/record-arrays/identifier-array.ts`
- Should this use Defined in or InheritedFrom? Should be defined in.
- Example page with no problem https://api.emberjs.com/ember-data/release/classes/%3CInterface%3E%20Cache

Fixed in https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-api-docs/pull/862

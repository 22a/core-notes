## Minutes

### 3.28

KG: Status is that CLI is being released even though the embroider/ember-data scenarios are broken, because they seemed broken in a previous release. And SP has a bunch of issues opened up to deal with the bugs in the build.

RJ: I think the ember cli beta for 4.0 will trigger a build of the super rentals tutorial which is a good smoke test for 4.0

RJ: So, goal is that ember-source will release 4 weeks from now.

KG: So, September 20th

MS: We should check with learning about a 3.28 blog post

KG: I think Kenneth had been doing this, but he has stepped back so we need to look at it

MB: I can tackle blog post prosing if @Robert Jackson can help with the component extraction

MB: Also, we need to bump up the glimmer vm version

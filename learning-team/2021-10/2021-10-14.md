## Topics

### Ember Times update (AL, 5-10min)

Amy has cubital tunnel (RSI) and needs to reduce typing. Amy spoke with Jared and may leave publish of the next 10/22 issue to him. Amy can verbally walk Jared thru the process on a video call / screenshare, and we can try to update the instructions as we go as well. Topics have been somewhat light recently. If there is not enough content, we could adjust the frequency. Amy is on vacation 10/29. 11/5 would be an option if 10/22 is pushed, assuming sticking with Fridays.

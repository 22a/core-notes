<!-- ### Your topic (INITIALS, expected duration in minutes) -->

### I was DM‚Äôd about this so I just wanted to know if there is a blocker https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import/pull/512 <@mansona>

- EF: no particular reason why this hasn't been merged
- high level: this makes ember-auto-import more like embroider
- the bug is that sometimes you get different module state between dev and test
- we need to make sure that the test entry point imports the app entry point
- I'll put it on a list to review
- https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import/pull/512 -- looks rebased and awaiting review <@NullVoxPopuli>

### What‚Äôs the status of the ‚Äúresolver refactor‚Äù work and is it in a state it‚Äôd be useful for me to try out in Intercom (is this unstable builds thing related to making it possible to test this stuff? - a bit out of the loop on this) <@achambers>

- status update
- we have eliminated on-disk app tree merging - our resolver can deal with it directly now
- this has eliminated some of the code that I was worried about releasing - we're in a better place to be releasable
- (discussion about releasing now)
- there are potentially some breaking changes on main that we need to discuss
- fine to have a breaking change if we teach people effectively
- we should have a wholistic plan - and avoid more breaking changes happening soon too
- AC: we're mostly concerned about build performance
- EF: this won't change too much quite yet, we will have a much better rebuild performance when we get to webpack watcher
- AC: we'll try out the new unstable. We have good observability on build time changes
- EF: not quite ready to be pushed to developers
- CM: are we aiming to get the webpack watcher working sooner rather than later? is this part of current work?
- EF: once we complete this work then it should be possible sooner rather than later
- we have eliminated the app folder issues but we still need to fix the node_modules rewriting
- https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1374 (work in progress)
- A: should we do a beta release? 
- EF: we could just do a release ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- CM: what's your feeling on releasing now or later?
- EF: let's try it for a week and then decide next week
- CM: I'll reach out to someone I know is using embroider in production


###¬†is @macro system expected to work in apps/ conditionally adding or excluding code at build time - use case would be adding in dev/test only libraries for mocking <@void_mAlex>

- A: setting up mock service worker
- conditionally include or exclude from final build
- doing this for an engine
- initially I have gone with a plain import in an initializer 
- I can't find an ergonomic way to do this 
- EF: does it need to work in classic or just embroider
- A: just embroider for me
- should the macro system work in apps?
- EF: yes
- the problem is that dynamicImportSync can't quite work in classic apps
- if it's a v2 addon then it will work even in classic
- this is related to allowing ember-auto-import be in control of a portion of your app
- CM: does that mean it's a blocker for getting the macros to work in this way?
- EF: yes, because everything in your app right now is put through the classic build pipeline and essentially concatinated

### Problem with babel-plugin-htmlbars-inline-precompile <@mansona>
This is still being used in addon blueprint even though it‚Äôs archived, should we upgrade the blueprint?
Should we also fix the issue
https://github.com/candunaj/template-precompile-scope/actions/runs/4479281106/jobs/7873046736#step:7:62

- CM: (explanation of the problem)
- EF: yes this is probably a spec bug
- we probably need to accept looser forms like this because of non-hand-written examples like this rollup reproduction
- the upcomming embroider release might cause more issues like this because we need to mangle more names
- this isn't an issue with the wire-format - the scope bag is an array of locals
- (more discussion)
- this test ensures that it's throwing an error: https://github.com/emberjs/babel-plugin-ember-template-compilation/blob/038cabde1709c49751c3224df66e6b4adfc4b60d/__tests__/tests.ts#L1372-L1380
- we should update the spec
- CM: do we need to PR the spec? do we need to PR the RFC? 
- EF: probably not. The PR will be a good start for the discussion and we can decide later
- CM: should we backport this?
- EF: we could ... but I'm not sure it matters


###¬†Some changes in the css loading when using unstable packages - not sure how since the app isn‚Äôt using embroider yet <@mansona>

- (long discussion)
- more investigation needed

### Build environments vs build target vs build command path forward and expectations re: https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/1377 <@void_mAlex>

- it is technially possible to have a production build where `isTesting()` isn't stripped but we don't have the implementation currently 
- EF: maybe "prod" is the wrong way of thinking this
- maybe "is this on a dev machine" and "is this on a server" is a better distinction
- "is this production" is too broad and we need more nuanced question
- "is this code being actively developed right now" 
- "should this code be debuggable" 
- lots of combinations of these answers for different scenarios
- macros are trying to decompose "isProd" a bit better
- isTesting is supposed to be "is the test suite running right now"
- "is this package under development" - for addon authors vs add developers consuming the addon 

### Review list of ember-data‚Äôs V2 addon blockers. <@ef4>

- message from runspired: https://discord.com/channels/480462759797063690/568935504288940056/1087142942751326279
- configure hook: https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/1303#issuecomment-1477978294
- the exact shape of the configure hook may look different to what one might expect
- we don't want to implement this until other refactors are done so we have a better view of what it needs to be done
- we do need to work with the cascading config case - passing config down one layer (which can be passed on explicitly)
- CM: should we have "good first issue" like label for issues that context could be shared amongst the working group
- EF: I just created `working-group` for this purpose

## Topics


### Is there some guidance for using the unstable packages in a monorepo? I‚Äôm having an issue where one part of the embroider build saying that this.adapter.resolverConfig is not a function. I‚Äôm assuming this means that there is a rogue embroider/shared-internals on the old version but does that mean there is a breaking change here that isn‚Äôt accounted for? <@mansona>

- potential major of one of the dependencies
- pair at the end of the call to see if we can identify

### What can I pick up to help? <@achambers>

- CM: what about instrumentation
- AC: don't want to put too much energy into instrumenting webpack
- EF: even on vite the meaning of "the build" means that you can't compare apples to apples
- AC: we only really care about the overview once we're at the end of this process. "are the devs having a good time" 

### is this the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù way to do gjs and gts in a v2 addon? https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/rollup-plugin-glimmer-template-tag <@mansona> 

- yes. nobody else has done it üòÇ
- not all of this is embroider related, some of it is just getting template tag to "recommended"
- PS: there are some issues on the single-pass compile because you need to figure out the babel settings
- EF: I think the single stage might not be possible
- the two stage thing where we pre-process and have a **private** intermediate format might be the way that we have to stick with it. 
- the pre-process step today sometimes gets it incorrect
- a good next step is to try swc tokeniser in ember-template-imports
- we would love to do it in one pass, but only if it was super fast
- it would be cool if we had the handlebars parser in rust and make it super quick
- (lots of discussion)
- EF: the transform/pre-processor needs to get out of this addon and ship as it's own package
- 2 steps: make gjs valid JS, and then convert it to setTemplate
- to avoid people targeting the intermediate format we should make it as ugly as possible
- ember-template-imports preprocessor needs to be in its own library
- as does the babel plugin
- PS: so much clean up will happen when we have this
- A: the future is bright ‚òÄÔ∏è
- https://github.com/ember-template-imports/ember-template-imports/issues/143
- EF: I'll create a repo, probably in emberjs


### Error in tests where environment !== ‚Äòtest‚Äô <@achambers>

- AC: essentially we can't get it to work when running `ember serve` and visiting `/tests`
- we are targeting a div for tests
- (long discussion about if this should have ever worked)
- EF: it could be that the test bundle should be overriding the config with define statements
- CM: we need a reproduction (it might not be as simple as it seems, try deleting tests in your own repo to find an import chain that causes the problem)

### RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded initial trace points to assets/<appname>.js <@void_mAlex>

- Digging a bit deeper it‚Äôs coming from core/src/module-resolver.js seems to be getting stuck on ember-cached-decorator-polyfill/index
- Just confirmed that removing the dependency boots the app

- (long discussion)
- essentially exports in v1 addons isn't really supported
- ember-cli will just ignore exports
- CM: I came across this somewhere else and I ended up deleting `exports` in the v1 addon re-write code
- EF: you could add something to the `rehome()` function that won't fix the issue but will make the error better
- if the rehome function if the request.fromFile points to the new fromFile then we should not return a new request (just return this)
- A: I can do this
- EF: that will fix the overflow, but the real problem is in `resolveWithinPackage`
- (discussion)
- if Alex can test adding `delete pkg.exports` in the newPackageJson method of `compat/src/v2addon.ts` then we can probably just ship it (if it works)

### https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/1382 <@simonihmig>

- SI: should we create a new helper that just curries the component
- EF: (adding a comment to the issue as I speak) (edit: didn't in the end üôÉ)
- the root issue is that the `{{component}}` helper can work with both objects and strings
- this is a real example where we would create a new component helper that didn't have string support
- SI: could we opt-into `{{component}}` not allowing strings? 
- EF: well we should be skipping this check in strict mode
- your addon needs to support only ember versions that support strict mode
- I think this should be supported on main
- SI: I can test unstable and see if it still has an issue

### just a quick review of extra tests <@void_mAlex> https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1381

- EF: looks good - can merge after green üëç

###  what prerequisites do we have for vite support? AMD-less builds? V2 apps? <@simonihmig>

- EF: I think it would be better that webpack or vite are driving, so we need an inversion of control
- I don't want `@embroider/vite` as a broccoli plugin (if it were even possible ü§î)
- the biggest issue is that importSync (a synchronous dynamic import) can work as a require
- vite needs modules all the way to the browser "truly modules"
- we can implement this by converting importSync to a normal import that is hoisted to the top of the file
- this will change the timing (but there is nothing we can do about this)
- SI: how do we deal with the vendorjs?
- EF: we can still expose things via the amd loader
- I want us to move away from this, over time the amd loader will have less and less in it
- A: can we tie down the next steps here? 
- CM: are the current two draft PRs related to this? 
- EF: yes. the main one was the rewriting node_modules one: https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1374
- CM: (question about being able to do other work in paralell)
- EF: some things that we could do in paralell
- having a webpack/babel/vite config in your directory (not automatically building it hidden)
- this doesn't mean having a massive config, just having an "embroider plugin"
- then we need to "package up" the pre-commands people will need (build my v1 addons into v2 - either watch or once off)
- at this point ember-cli-build.js won't be driving any more
- there is also code in "stage 2" (changes made to your app code) will need to move into your pre-build stuff too
- e.g. when we synthasise the entry points to the app - that should be a lib that we call from the webpack plugin
- CM: this sounds like the rodemap item to "spike a v2 app" https://github.com/orgs/embroider-build/projects/1?pane=issue&itemId=14430981
- EF: maybe. it depends. we still probably want a compatibility layer here.
- it does make the work easier if we don't support a bunch of classic build stuff
- i.e. no custom broccoli
- we also need to fix the config environment - currently implemented with strange broccoli merging
- CM: we should have people shadow EF to watch current implementation
- EF: if anyone wants to help with the early bootset work in ember-auto-import and the layering PR
-

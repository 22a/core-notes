## Minutes

### (10min) `String.prototype.htmlSafe` deprecation backporting?

PR: [https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/19654](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/19654)

(discussion)

Agreement: We should release the deprecation in a point release of 3.27.x, and also in 3.28.

GC & RM: It seems like there are also some issue related to test helpers and isHTMLSafe and htmlSafe in 3.27.

GC: tldr in some cases you get isHTMLSafe is not a function, something with the import

### (10min) {{outlet 'named'}}

Agreement: We can make named outlets into an assert. We can turn this into a debug build assert during template compilation.

Suggestion: We could backport a deprecation, but we're not sure there is much value in this.

We can't just ignore it since {{outlet}} {{outlet 'foo'}} can't mean two outlets

### (10min) {{this.attrs}}

GC suggests: {{this.args}} and {{this.attrs}} should be linted errors

However both should work, because they just work in the normal flow of the component system.

### (10min) assert/deprecate/ignore args

GC: I think it is fine to keep assertions. The way I have structured it is that there is a new implementation which is a pristine glimmer component implementation. Then I have a bunch of monkey patches to add the old features, in the case where it doesn't support an arg it falls back to the old implementation

GC: The plan is we should be able to delete the old implementation and monkey patch.

GC: However we need to move these to the legacy addon before we can do that anyway. Someone signed up to do the work, but in practice the solution of copy-past the implementation and tests wasn't really so clean. The work has stalled a little bit. We went back to the strategy of keeping it in Ember and reexporting it. Now we need to do the work to remove it.

Suggestion: You could lint all these args. We would likely accept adding an assertion, or changing the deprecations to assertions.

GC: Main blocker for getting these extracted are the tests. We could say we don't care about the tests.

We should revisit this in about two weeks. If we're still blocked in two weeks on landing any removals we can then revisit.

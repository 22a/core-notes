### Contributor's workshop post-mortem (RM, 20m)

Last week Chris and I ran the EmberFest contributor workshop with the help of other mentors.
I'd like to discuss how the event went, how some decision panned out, and what I think can be improved.

### Deprecation of loc from (at)ember/string

PR: https://github.com/ember-learn/deprecation-app/pull/688
I'm working on shipping the [`@ember/string`](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0236-deprecation-ember-string.html) deprecations piece by piece, with `loc` being the first one.
I'd like a review with the intention of getting the first version published so I can refer to it from the implementation.

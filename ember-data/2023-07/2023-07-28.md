## Initiatives

### Typescript

- Brad moved EmberData to using ember-source types (precursor)
- Any tasks that would be good to surface for community contribution?
    - migrate loose mode files to strict mode
    - type remaining JS files (only a few of these)

### Release Prep

- Next release is 5.2 (release week starts August 7th), checklist is https://github.com/emberjs/data/issues/8743
- Any tasks that would be good to surface for community contribution?

## Agenda

- Typescript Infra
    - quite a few types could be published today either as unstable / stable
    - def typed types are mostly good enough, the thing that’s blocking is release infra
        - we don’t publish types at all today
        - we want to move what is produced into something that’s marked as preview/unstable for an end user to import if they want
    - could potentially use the v2 addon blueprint (w/o templates) as a reference to achieve some of this
        - https://github.com/embroider-build/addon-blueprint/tree/main/files/__addonLocation__
        - unpublished dev types
- Typescript Updates
    - Chris has gone thru a lot of them
    - entirety of store package is now subject to strict types
    - graph package is also strictly typed (lots of hidden complexity, so this should help)
- Prep for Breaking Lockstep
    - learning team to meet about the API docs version drop down
    - need to write/pub a blog post that addresses break from lockstep
    - if this can occur b/f the release of 5.2 then we won’t release with the other packages
    - if we can’t achieve this we’ll either release w/o polish or re-release 5.1
- Dual Publishing
    - if can do it in 5.2 that’s optimal, but need to do it by next LTS
    - will take a bit of infra (Chris doesn’t have time)
    - soft agmt that a name change can occur
        - a number of users are blocked from upgrading due to the name
        - if we dual publish under new name alongside old name then this would unblock them
    - exact same version and code just under the new name WarpDrive
- Review RFC Statuses
    - https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/887
        - intend to discontinue.
        - update RFC text to state it is discontinued
        - PR to update should have its own FCP
    - https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/910
        - implementation is complete
        - in repo docs are there but not external docs
        - deprecations are implemented but not ported
    - https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/924
        - everything had been done except updating the deps frontmatter, we handled and moved to recommended stage during the meeting
    - https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/925
        - Moving to release during the meeting
        - Won’t move to recommended until schema model is shipped b/c relationships (no good way to handle w/ legacy compat handler and drop adapters/serializers)
    - https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/926
        - doesn’t have super great documentation BUT does have all the public API documented
        - moving to recommend based on this

## Action items

- Jared moves these notes to core-notes repo

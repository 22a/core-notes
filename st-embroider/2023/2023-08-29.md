## Topics

### spend some time recording real tasks remaining for the content-tag work in the roadmap

- Addon blueprint
- ember-template-imports 
- eslint 
- prettier 

- this is where we seem to be tracking: https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/20062
- CM: I'll update the roadmap to point to this one
- 

### continue discussion from last week - should we finally deprecate pods? We had issues running an app in vite with pods structure, `template.hbs` wasnâ€™t getting rewritten <@mansona>

- CM: we came across this issue when testing an app in vite
- EF: we need to support pods, they will be fine in the gjs world so we don't want to have busywork for people that they don't need to do
- it sounds like you discovered a bug that we need to fix
- CM: I'll create a reproduction and we can work from there

### importSyncImplementation `eager` for template strings - any guidance on how to make this work? <@mansona>

- EF: this is part of the import-glob RFC
- https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/939
- this is essentially what webpack is already doing
- CM: is there any implementation yet
- EF: no not yet, but it's almost ready to progress
- 

### what am I doing wrong regarding https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/1583 <@void-mAlex>

- we need to specify the sub-dependencies that need to be optimised because we are explicitly not optimising our addons 
- if they depenend on deps that are CJS then it will break because vite does the conversion from cjs to esm in optimisation
- we need to turn off the exclusion of our addons and see what starts to break

### Vite issues? Too early? https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/polaris-starter/issues/10 <@NullVoxPopuli>

- EF: vite apps shouldn't have ember-template-imports installed
- we support content-tag directly in embroider
- PS: that doesn't work because glint needs it as a peer
- EF: you can try to disable the addon in the build 
- but really glint should be using content-tag directly
- we don't want all these parsers floating around

### @ember/template-compiler/runtime? (https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/931) Did this get implemented? <@NullVoxPopuli>

- EF: not implemented yet
- nobody is working on this
- it will be easier after the work in ember-source that supports strict modules

### We need to do something about `/// reference` in v2 addon nsc/glint builds -- best / light-weight handling seen so far: https://github.com/jmurphyau/ember-truth-helpers/blob/master/packages/ember-truth-helpers/package.json#L19 <@NullVoxPopuli>

- CM: what is this? ðŸ™ˆ
- https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/triple-slash-directives.html
- PS: any v2 addon generated now would have this problem
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/ember-element-helper/v/0.8.2?activeTab=code `/ember-element-helper/declarations/helpers/element.d.ts`

```js
/// <reference types="ember-source/types/preview/@ember/object/core" />
/// <reference types="ember-source/types/preview/@ember/object/mixin" />
```

- CM: if the problem is that `preview` is in the reference shouldn't it be part of our semver that we don't remove that in later versions
- EF: this is typescript leaking internals
- CM: this seems like something for the Ember TS Team meeting
- PS says that he's going to follow up on this one


### Embroider build error: https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/1585 <@achambers>

- EF: it would be good to move the error to the constructor so it would be hit
- the reduceInstances only happens when there are other copies
- actually this is a different name, the old name `ember-test-waiters` instead of `@ember/test-waiters`
- CM: should we create a compat adapter for `ember-test-waiters` that always throws?
- EF: 

### how do we feel about merging ember-cli-update now (with caveats) https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-update/pull/1243  <@mansona>

- (discussion of the problem)
- EF: it's probably fine to merge with CI being better but not perfect
- it's probably not ok to merge with a git dependency - we should wait for that to be released properly
- CM: I have pinged Kelly to do a release but no response yet
- (general discussion about asking to move boilerplate-update to the org)
- 

### merge https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/10353 ? <@kategengler>

- yes! Merged

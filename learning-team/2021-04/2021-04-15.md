### Ember Welcome Page confustion (CM, 10m)

We were recently contacted on Twitter and in our discord about some confusion around how Ember Welcome Page works https://discord.com/channels/480462759797063690/480777444203429888/828882938945994752 and https://twitter.com/ankushdharkar/status/1379286286469505024

The gist of the situation is that we should probably just generate the component in the newly generated app. RM has an old PR that started work on this so if I'm not at the meeting he probably has more context on this than I do. 

### clean up fastly configuration (RM, 10m)

I was checking our Fastly configuration and noticed several configured services that have not had activity in a while.
We should clean up any unnecessary configuration.

### Api Docs Update (JW, 5mins)

- continued to move the work forward
- summary of the current situation
  - docs are pulled directly from the released code
  - moving to release from a git repo
  - can make changes after releases (without releasing npm packages)
  - no longer need AWS credentials
- Project board https://github.com/orgs/ember-learn/projects/68
  - the list may look big but we are at the point where we have known list of items
  - we're not yet at the point where we can share the link but we will soon ask for testers
  - 

### Talk about syntax highlighting (I, 10mins)

- https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/issues/1959
- there is a PR for this into octane cheat sheet
  - https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-octane-vs-classic-cheat-sheet/pull/112
- (discussion about not being able to right away for the guides)
- CM: we need to discuss the authoring format of this
- I: https://vitepress.dev/guide/markdown#code-groups
  - this is how you would do the tabs
- alternatively we could write in typescript and transpile
- RM: we talked with the TS team before and we concluded that it wouldn't be sufficent just to transpile the code examples i.e. you would need to have specific prose to go with the guides
- JW: we had someone to do an audit to see how common this would be. This audit wasn't completed
- we have more flexibility in the octane-vs-classic-cheat-sheet
- it doesn't have so many blockers
- it doesn't need much descriptions (it's intended to be brief) so doesn't have the problem of swapping TS code and related descriptions
- (discussion about being happy with cheat-sheet)
- RM: if we're going to change how we write docs is getting into RFC teritory, the way that we do things may not be the best but they are done that way for a reason
- RM: we could tackle a smaller side-project like the the deprecations app to experiment with

- (moved on and came back)
- JW: I opened https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-octane-vs-classic-cheat-sheet/issues/113 to track work on adding TS code examples to the cheat-sheet

### Ember Styleguide DX update (CM, 5 mins)

- issues with hot-reload of CSS files have gone away (or will soon once I submit a PR)

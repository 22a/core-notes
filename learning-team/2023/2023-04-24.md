## Topics

### Ember API docs upgrade report (CM + JW, 5mins)

- CM: basic overview: use git as the main data store
- (long discussion of the current state)
- next steps: 
  - update the data in the repo https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-api-docs-data either by just downloading S3 or running the process again
  - update ember-api-docs to be 3.28 (to hopefully prevent the memory leaks)
  - figure out what routes have errors on them (it doesn't seem too clear in the prember output)
  - don't try to prember invalid routes (i.e. events pages for modules that don't have events)

### documentation is full of broken links üò≠ (AG, 2mins)

https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/20404

- AG: can they look into it? 
- CM: as long as fixing one thing doesn't break others. i.e. if we make it work for recent versions it doesn't break it for older versions
- AG: I have replied

### Ember API docs deployment report (JW JG, 5mins)

- JG: during deployment there was no guard for temp files 
- JG: should we move the deployment into a github action
- CM: *caution!* let's try not to make things too complicated
- also we aren't months away (I think)
- AG: I agree that we shouldn't complicate things but we **should** be finding ways to automate with github actions
- JG: agree to spend time on "newer better thing" but we should have a cut off (maybe emberconf?) where we need to not worry about it


### ember-help-wanted-server update (CM, 5mins)

- CM: it's probably fine ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- maybe the right solution here is to make sure that the server logs show that there is a permissions problem
- I'll create an issue üëç

### Tomster route website (AG, 5mins)

- (long discussion) 
- chris is sad
- tldr we need to enable EXPERIMENTAL_RENDER_MODE_SERIALIZE so that the html is stable after loading ember
- Chris will reply to the issue and explain the best he can üôÉ

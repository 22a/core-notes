## Topics

<!-- If you would like to add a topic to the agenda please add a suggestion to the PR using the following format: -->
<!-- ### Your topic (INITIALS, expected duration in minutes) -->

### Letâ€™s ship: https://github.com/emberjs/babel-plugin-ember-template-compilation/pull/21 <@achambers>

- EF: yes let's ship
- I don't know who has release permissions
- one thing to fix before merging
- it's probably a minor 

### Double fingerprinting issue: should we prioritize this? https://github.com/embroider-build/ember-auto-import/issues/537 <@mansona>

- a lot of apps have a confused view of your rootUrl
- you can use prepend to fix a wrong definition of rootUrl
- should investigate it
- it is worth debugging

### css-loader default options appear to not be set to default, breaking CSS imports (like `@import 'some-file.css' inside of `app.css`. Is this intended? <@nickschot>

- pushed to next week

### the 5.1 release broke ci (TS scenarios) <@NullVoxPopuli>

- will look into it

<2 mins> ci + workflow_dispatch <@NullVoxPopuli>

- https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1477
- merged

### testing updates to ember-cli (copies from embroider) <@NullVoxPopuli>

- https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/10296
- looks good 
- out of date - updated with rebase before merging


### delete .DS_Store <@NullVoxPopuli>

- https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1476
- merged


### addon watch tests (they stable!) <@NullVoxPopuli> 

- https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1473
- merged


### status update on Embroider by default, specifically RFC746 and RFC763 <@simonihmig>

- https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/746
- https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/763

- EF: my own prioritisation order was to land the inversion of control before we even try to make it the default
- asset import spec is also a blocker
- v2 app format is probably part of the same effort
- SI: we should probably also need the ember-auto-import feature to import your own files
- EF: yes someone starting the work on ember-auto-import would help
- CM: could someone start now on the inversion of control
- EF: there are a few things that should happen after the node_modules
- cleanups like removing the app differs
- e.g. the synthesized packages that are part of stage 2 should be moved into the resolver
- if we move this to the resolver we wouldn't need to implement features for synthesized packages


### Quick pass through some PRs to make sure people are getting feedback:

- https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1478

  - basic idea is right
  - if someone can help get tests passing once we fix the typescript test issues

- https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-cli-addon-docs/pull/1454/files

  - (discussion about knowing about the fact that you're in an embroider build)
  - we gently want to push people away from this
  - 


### ember-engines default app re-exports troll for classic and embroider builds <@void-mAlex>

- (conversation had during office hours)
- we can figure out next steps

### Strange things on the ember data tests https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1479 <@mansona>

- CM: I don't know if this is an ember-data issue or an embroider issue
- EF: we have a PR that we can work with 

### auto-import issue triage <@void-mAlex> https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/1254

- I thought there was a test for this
- it would be good to find where in the tests it isn't covered
- this is very fixable if someone wants to pick it up

### when can we merge the node_modules PR so people can test the unstable packages ergonomically <@mansona on behalf of @22a>

- we are going to wait for the tests to be green
- there will be a bit of time between merging and releasing

## Weekly review

## Topics

### Goals brainstorming

Unstructured, no decisions to make here. What do we want the experience to be
for learning Ember? This is a meta conversation like we used to do for
face-to-face meetings. The eventual outcome would be to refine the list
to have some high level goals we can use to inform our decision making
about what to prioritize.

## Topics

### Strategy for usage of deprecated APIs in content (RM, 15m)
https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/19729 was brought to our attention recently.
Because route/controller transition methods have been deprecated, the API documentation is not visible by default and the links seem to go nowhere.
Although it was clearly a lapse that the documentation was not updated accordingly, some questions came to mind:
- Do we want to reevaluate not showing deprecated code by default?
- Do we want to adjust how the approach prose changes for staged RFCs? Should we link to API documentation with the deprecated query param enabled?

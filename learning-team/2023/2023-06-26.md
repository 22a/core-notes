## Topics

<!-- If you would like to add a topic to the agenda please add a suggestion to the PR using the following format: -->
<!-- ### Your topic (INITIALS, expected duration in minutes) -->

### 5.1 release
JG will help with the blog part, and can do the actual release.
CM wanted to volunteer too, to test the tool and the updated documentation.
JG will do it, and CM will pair and be back-up.

### Deprecation extraction script update (CM)
There is a tool to check if the versions and deprecations are nicely working together. It works historically, checking against a point in time. Currently the deprecations in the TypeScript files don't work yet.

### Discord EmberTimes bot
CM transferred this to Pat O'Callighan (from Intercom) because they wanted to give back on also non-technical things to the community ðŸ¥³

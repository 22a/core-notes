Continuing the conversation, from where we left off last week:

The TS team wants to introduce TS into learning resources:

- A toggle for code samples, which could impact prose. Could be a
full website toggle or a per-code-sample toggle.
- Take content from docs.ember-cli-typescript.com and incorporate into the
guides

The TS team is willing to do the work

Our burning questions to share and come back to:

- How many code samples actually need different prose to go with them?
- Forgetting about how it looks in the app, how does it look in the
markdown? Two code blocks in sequence? How do we make sure they are the same?
  - Write code samples in TS, they compile down to JS automatically
  - This would mean all code samples need to be written in TS, could be a
    barrier to entry for contributors
- Do all code samples need to have TS?
- What does it look like if we plan for the ideal scenario?

### Goals brainstorming

Unstructured, no decisions to make here. What do we want the experience to be
for learning Ember? This is a meta conversation like we used to do for
face-to-face meetings. The eventual outcome would be to refine the list
to have some high level goals we can use to inform our decision making
about what to prioritize.

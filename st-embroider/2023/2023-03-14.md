### Any advice on typescript and decorators in v2 addons? <@mansona>

- CM: we should have decorators in the addon output
- EF: can't do anything else right now because rollup doesn't have a parser that understands decorators
- you should have legacy decorators in your babel config 
- we need to get the rest of the ember community to the new spec decorators
- we need to find a way to allow both new and old systems to interop
- acornjs is used by rollup and they explicitly doesn't support decorators: https://github.com/acornjs/acorn/blob/master/bin/test262.unsupported-features
- CM: so we can't do anything right now ðŸ™ƒ
- EF: well we could do something else
- we could create a non-decorator syntax for addons 
- if we're transpiling the decorators you're locking into that implementation of decorators
- CM: seems late in the game to create a new syntax for this if it's stage 3
- EF: yes but things could move quite slowly
- maybe we shouldn't do anything until we figure out ember's story for new decorators
- we could get it to work both ways
- CM: rfc? 
- EF: if we can make it work in a compatible way then we don't need to
- if there is a bunch of user-facing settings then we might need a RFC
- https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/876

###  ecosystem v2 addon conversions blocked on humans ðŸ™ƒ <@NullVoxPopuli>

- https://github.com/emberjs/ember-test-helpers/pull/1325
- EF: I chatted to katie about this
- it's related to wanting an RFC about this
- this also opened up a much larger conversation related to pnpm being a first-class-citizen for addons
- (discussion in general about pnpm)
- we technically don't need pnpm for this implementation
- there are 3 changes
  - pnpm
  - v2 addon (nobody will object to this)
  - monorepo
- technically we don't need a monorepo for a v2 addon
- we don't need to block addon conversion on pnpm and monorepo
- (discussion about skipping pnpm conversion in this conversion)
- 

### gjs/gts (figured out!) -- path to ship: plugins in ember-template-imports on @embroider/addon-dev <@NullVoxPopuli> 

- what is the tooling to get gjs supported in v2 addons
- stable api for this in ember
- but how to do this conveniently (i.e. rollup plugins etc.)

- EF: I did some experimentation for different implementation for ember-template-imports
- I directly extended babel to support this
- the implementation right now is not fully correct - we think we need a better tokeniser (maybe the one in SWC)
- there is an example of this working in just babel - downside we have to maintain the fork of the babel parser
- could be automated with github actions but would still be annoying
- it makes sense that the pre-processor exists in ember-template-imports
- it also kinda makes sense that rollup plugin lives in there too
- https://github.com/ember-template-imports/ember-template-imports/pull/132#discussion_r1133114260
- (more discussions)
- with peer dependencies it might make sense to deploy as its own package - so that consumers of ember-template-imports won't get rollup deps if they aren't using it
- it might be more appropriate for addon dev to have a single plugin that takes you all the way from `<template>` to the correct template call in ember
- this prevents you from having to output from ember-template-imports and then changed in babel again
- PS: we have this all working right now with one caveat - you need to set `transpileOnly: true`
- this is ok if you see typechecking as a lint


### Started extracting blueprint system - very strange stuff in there <@mansona>

- general discussion

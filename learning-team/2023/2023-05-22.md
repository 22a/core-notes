## Topics

### Quick Ember 5 Update (JW, 5 min)
The main thing people are waiting for is the EmberData release, Jared will fill in the Data stuff in the blog, Katie will fill in the `ember/string` deprecation, she also put some info in the deprecation guide. JW will fill in the rest of the gaps. 

### Ember API Docs Prember (CM, 10 min)
CM and JW chatted about this already. There are some issues with API docs data. With the GitHub flow we can finally lint the data, throw errors and possibly also fix it. Every URL that we are having issue with currently are also broken in production, so [this PR](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-api-docs-data/pull/7) will fix it. We only need to lint the last patch version of a minor. One of the lint rules will remove the duplicate files, we could add one that removes older patch version files, the other lint rule `functions/properties don't have names`. We now have a successful Prember build. The last step is to download the data from S3 and add the missing data to the GitHub repo, and then run the linting again.

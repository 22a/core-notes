### Give deprecations more structure (RM, 15min)
RM: Deprecation guides don't have a consistent feel to them, and authors don't have good guidelines on how to approach them, either.
RM: We also have a lot of before/after examples, but no real application-support.
RM: I think we could improve on this, and have a couple ideas of increasing ridiculousness :P

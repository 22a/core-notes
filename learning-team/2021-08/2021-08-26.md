## Topics

### Volta in our repos

Do we want to suggest using volta? We want it to be optional.

https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/1714

What node version manager do we recommend? Any version manager is ok.
We will provide guidance to contributors to check their node version
and where to find it.

### Ember blog (CM)

A problem related to Fastboot

The Ember blog is not rendering in fastboot correctly.
Metadata works but none of the content is in the html.
You can see this by looking at blog.emberjs.com and looking at page source.
It's really short. This is caused by the htmlsafe deprecation.
CM has released a version of empress blog to fix this.

Mentioning it because it's something to keep an eye on.

JW: Can we write a test for this, without a ton of extra work?
CM: Probably? But it's working in the browser but not in fastboot.
Usually when there's an error thrown in fastboot, the build fails, but
that didn't happen in this case.

### CSS for the tutorial

No updates this week, waiting on contributor response.

### Quick check for new Ember 4 work

No new work requirements from our last check.

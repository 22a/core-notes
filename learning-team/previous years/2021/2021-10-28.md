## Topics

### Backfilling release blog posts
https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-blog/pull/1051

RM: the question was whether we backfill missing deprecation/other details for release blog posts
RM: I think default answer is yes, because we want the posts to be accurate

### Sharing secrets within the team
RM: so, I am once again working on tool-new-release and at the moment I am getting some necessary variables from an heroku instance becauseâ€¦ that was the most lazy way to do it :P
RM: I'd like for us to have a proper way to share secrets, and hopefully simplify the release process a tad more.
RM: What does the team think about something like [1Password Teams for Open Source Projects](https://github.com/1Password/1password-teams-open-source)? Would that along with the [op CLI](https://support.1password.com/command-line/) be something we want to pursue?

## Topics

### Standing agenda item: Who is working on what tasks and do you need help with context? (generate agenda items, don’t use this time to discuss)
<10 mins> What’s the latest with the node_modules rewriting PR? We haven’t mentioned that in a while (I see there is a new one) <@achambers>

  - https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1435

- (discussion of latest changes)
- we just deleted the node_modules rewriting code
- expect some more tests failing
- it's getting quite close

### maybe bundled with the first agenda item? Review issues / PRs – discuss labeling system, so we can know if something needs more work, or needs to be looked at, or needs to be looked at by a certain person (passive async communication) – don’t want PRs / issues to get forgotten <@NullVoxPopuli>

- PS: we don't currently look over issues and PRs
- EF: I'm not going to be creating labels and triage
- it would be good to have a label so that we can list things that need discussion
- CM: I considered that a bit of my time under the initiative will be dedicated to triage
- 

<5+ mins> ember-cli PRs <@NullVoxPopuli>
  - Minor CI updates: https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/10286 (nvp)

- EF: we can merge this
- we should probably all have commit permissions on ember-cli - we are the build tools team now
- we should chat to Melanie or Katie to discuss what team syncing infra there is out there

  - `--typescript` fix: https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/10283 (Simon)

- (discussion about git ignore or clean up or both)
- EF: let's do both


### scenario helpers refactor https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1454 <@NullVoxPopuli>

- CM: note: this is changing the deleted flakey test
- EF: we should re-add the coverage for this, I commented on the issue https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/1465#issuecomment-1588370642
- rollup gives us a JS api that gives us events

### ember-cli-babel@v8 status – what’s left? <@NullVoxPopuli>

- EF: there is a quest issue: https://github.com/babel/ember-cli-babel/issues/453
- we need to make sure that we have enough permissions to do this stuff
- it's very close and just needs to be released
- someone just needs to take ownership and be responsive once it releases
- PS: I volunteer as tribute

### status update on layer-gen <@mansona>

- CM: core object has been removed 
- 100s of passing tests
- 50ish tests failing because of mostly fixture stuff

### issues template and requesting basic info what we’d like to see on there <@void-mAlex>

- EF: seems good
- if someone can volunteer that would be great

### can we merge https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1463 <@mansona>

- EF: merged

### can we release @embroider/macros? <@simon>

- (going through unlabeled changes)
- PR release preparation done https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1470

### advice on `<script>` order in index.html as v2 conversions happen in core addons <@NullVoxPopuli>

- (discussion of the problem)
- EF: if you need to change the order now, why did it ever work
- I have a feeling this is more about globals
- PS: I'll investigate

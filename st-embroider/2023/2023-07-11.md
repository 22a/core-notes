## Topics

### review behaviour of ember-svg-jars updates for embroider optimized https://github.com/ghedamat/ember-svg-jar/pull/252 <@void-mAlex>

- (discussion of the approach)
- the question is: is this a good approach for a v1 app
- EF: this is ok. It's not worse than what was there
- 

### clean-css PR: https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-clean-css/pull/303 <@NullVoxPopuli>

- KG: we need to get more clarification on what exactly broke here
- it was intended to exactly the same as what the pre-process registry did, we shouldn't expect it to fail for anyone
- it would be helpful if anyone could test if 5.0 css has changed at all

### discuss 3.1 app changes https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/1515 <@void-mAlex>

- EF: this is a good point
- the default webpack config does its chunk splitting based on if it finds things in node_modules
- I would like to give the option to allow you to not rewrite your app
- it's not a small change, but we could keep refactoring so there is less and less in the rewritten app
- unless you need custom broccoli trees in your app
- this could be part of a performance regression - i.e. app getting rolled into vendor
- we should create an issue about this

### Create Embroider/v2 addon FAQ/Cookbook <@simonihmig>

- SI: there are a lot of questions about how to do things
- A: should we have an embroider guides
- CM: this sounds like we did with the octane guides
- let's create a markdown file under `docs` folder before we create infra for this - we can fix it when the document gets too long
- (we disabled wiki)
- 

### @ember/string should it be in deps or not? <@void-mAlex>

- PS: ember resolver adds it as a peerDependency
- CM: if you're importing something you need to have it in your dep or peerDep
- EF: have we marked `@ember/string` as "do not use" yet?
- KG: we could internalise `@ember/string` into resolver and then deprecate it


### release automation https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1492 <@NullVoxPopuli>

- (going over PR)
- (discussion about multiple merges to main in quick succession - will it do the wrong thing?)
- we are holding off merging until we solve this issue
- comment added to the PR 

### ember-try + pnpm option https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-try/pull/958 <@NullVoxPopuli>

- maybe just use `--no-lockfile`
- KG: we can just use that then 

### ember-cli backports https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/10300 <@NullVoxPopuli>

- KG: branches exist so you can create PRs

### What are our thoughts of adding tests to individual packages of the monorepo? While it’s good to have scenario-tester end-to-end tests it could be nice to do some things in mocha like the rollup plugin <@mansona>

- EF: yes that's fine, but execute it from the scenarios
- you can use the "jest test bridge" as an inspiration for this

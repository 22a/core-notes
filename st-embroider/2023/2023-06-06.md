## Topics

###  Help out new folks via this PR / alias. <@NullVoxPopuli>

  - https://github.com/emberjs/ember/pull/4

- EF: If this does reliably run then it would be good
- do we get the right exit code?

### [ember-cli topic] Can we release ember-try <@mansona>

- EF I'll reach out to katie about this and potentially coming to this meeting

### Surprising embroider test passing in a dummy app
  - https://github.com/ronco/ember-cli-head/actions/runs/5165632352/jobs/9305284823
  - Why don‚Äôt I see the same issue that you see downstream? https://github.com/ember-learn/guidemaker-ember-template/actions/runs/4900982499/jobs/8752012595?pr=133#step:6:245
  - What is the current best way to do this ‚Äúapp provided‚Äù (or other addon provided) template? ü§î

- EF: this is supposed to work - we can try to debug it
- debugging it `DEBUG=embroider:resolver ember s`
- search for the thing it's trying to find (head.hbs)
- the problem is that the mergemap is just pulling out the extensions and in ember-meta head.hbs includes the extension
- searchAppTree in module-resolver
- if we get a request with an extension just look it up
- if you don't have an extension try it with .js then .hbs (also .hbs.js after hbs)
- also don't strip the extensions in the merge map
- tests are in `core-resolver-tests.ts`
- EF: I'll make a PR that you can start from https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1463


### storeConfigInMeta test scenario - WIP, chat https://github.com/22a/embroider/pull/1/files <@22a>

- PM: why is the test failing
- EF: I think tests need `location: none` and that's why it's failing


###¬†Auto Import issue: https://github.com/embroider-build/ember-auto-import/issues/582 Simon

- (discussion about the problem)
- not exactly sure how to fix this now
- the reason why both branches are in the output is because some macros want to have runtime code paths
- macroCondition has a runtime
- dependencySatisfies is buildtime only
- macroCondition could be sensitive to the fact that it only wraps build time macros it could become build time
- the bigger picture problem: can we get even classic apps have different module graphs?

guidance on how to tackle the issue
- packages/macros/src/babel/macro-condition
- ConfidentFalse
- ConfidentResult
- we should add an extra value to ConfidentResult to say if it has a runtime value like `needsRuntimeImplementation`
- then the code in macro-condition can use that info from the evaluator

### Blueprint portability in the new system - should we have a ‚Äútarget dir‚Äù defined somewhere so component blueprint will work in monorepo and non-monorepo v2 addons <@mansona>

- (discussion)
- cd into the package and run the blueprint there
- even if the dep is part of the monorepo it would work

### Help out new folks (part deux) via this PR / alias. <@NullVoxPopuli>

### Embroider release <A>

- A: shall we
- EF: yes! done

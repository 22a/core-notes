### Releases

RJ: CLI is ready to release for 3.27. Easy, and I'll try to do it today.

RJ: 3.27-beta for CLI has a little changelog, but seems pretty good to go.

GC: IE11 removal from targets for CLI will land into 3.27

RJ: So when we delayed the release we said the clock would restart.

RJ: Someone needs to work on the list of stuff that needs to happen for 4.0 on master. We need to formally decide whether we want to do the legacy 3.x addon or not. I was swayed by consensus that the old ones were basically not used.

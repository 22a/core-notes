## Topics

### Help on embroider/issues/1387 <@achambers>

- (lots of discussions around the issue)
- A: try wrap the `config/environment.js` with embroider macros
- CM: put a breakpoint on the line that ed suggested so we can see what is being emitted by `this.inputTree.readConfig`

### Discuss methods to ‚Äúbook‚Äù pairing sessions <@mansona>

- CM: how do we feel about a "book a slot" system? 
- (general agreement)
- A: alternative idea - a second office hours that is dedicated to just working on stuff that we can shadow (or get help)
- CM: or we can just get ed to live stream on twitch üòÇ
- CM: I like A's suggestion because it's simpler
- AC: it would be good to have a tour of the internals and the details of the plan
- CM: what if we make it public like the deep dives Intercom did with Yehuda



### can we merge https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1389 to bump unstable by at least a patch <@mansona>

- who has merge permission?
- A: I used to have it
- CM: as core team members we all need permission to merge
- (discussion about the PR)
- all agreed to merge it
- this brings up the previous conversation about needing an ember-source-url style implementation for embroider tests

### can we merge https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import/pull/573 ? Also are the babel settings right? <@mansona>

- merged

### review/merge https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1391 <@void_mAlex>

- (discussion about the change)
- CM: I think it's the right change
- can we add tests
- (investigation around tests of this function)
- it looks like there are no unit tests for this 
- we could create a scenario test
- A: I'll take a look at that

### merge https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1381 <@void_mAlex>

- PLZ merge

### https://github.com/ember-template-imports/ember-template-imports/pull/146 <@nullvoxpopuli>

- (discuss the merits of the PR)
- CM: can't we just move the implementation when we split the library to improve backwards compatibilty
- PS: this is actually the old way of doing this and we don't need to support it any more
- it actually outputs the intermediate format 
- CM: yea we didn't want to have anything target that intermediate format üôà or at least keep the number of things that do very low
- can you give more context so I can understand if we want to merge this?
- PS: https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/ember-template-imports/ 
- CM: this is perfect! 
- (more general discussion)
- CM: I think we can approve this change (even though we don't have permission to really approve) but we shouldn't have this block the work to separate the lib if we don't get it merged first
- DL: PS can you add the context that you gave us to the PR? this discussion was really helpful to understand the need for the PR and it might be helpful on the PR too üëç
- PS: sure I can do that 

### talk about the feasibility of some router ideas for exposing loading templates as a high priority download and parse based on a convention of exporting a named constant from templates imported and used in router.js; some extra context and pseudo code examples https://gist.github.com/void-mAlex/e9a73e77ad12668eade751bf6a8121be <@void_mAlex>

- A: probably something to chat about when ed gets back 
- CM: have you shared this with the team working on polaris routing? 
- A: i think so ü§∑ not much of a response (other than from PS!)

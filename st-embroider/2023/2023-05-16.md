## Topics

### ember 5 + CI, oh no! <@NullVoxPopuli>

- EF: we were debugging this in the extended office hours
- CM pointed out that we were pinning an old version of ember data
- we identified an issue with ember-test-waiters and we have a good compat adapter for it now

### addon-dev optimizations <@NullVoxPopuli>

- https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1423
- PS: I wanted to find a way to test this
- EF: we do have a way to do rebuild tests with scenario tester
- `compat-dummy-app-test` does this. It uses a rebuilder tests infrastructure
- this is specifically for ember-cli (doing some broccoli specific things)
- looking at the PR again, we can probably just use JSON.stringify and compare the strings
- and that would mean we wouldn't need to add a test
- PS: I'll update the PR

### release status? <@mansona>

- EF: I've updated the release infra
- before we had independent versioning we were able to use release it fine, it just can't help you plan version bumps
- I haven't opened a PR because I want to add some documentation first
- I haven't integrated it with infra yet
- we will likely need to intervene e.g. if you have a label on a PR that is breaking but it touches another package that isn't breaking
- (summary of some of the changes to peerDependencies and workspace dependencies)
- high-level overview is that changesets doesn't work with our needs
- too much work to make it work the way we need
- (demo of the new release infrastructure)

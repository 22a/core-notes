## Topics

### Named blocks (5 min)

Anne-Greeth was working on something for the website, and found that
named-blocks is not documented. There's a good place to put a new page for it.
Anne-Greeth may be taking the lead.

JW will post in chat with details about people who may be able to help.
Need to consider Release Stages. However RFC lacks "how we teach this"
section, though it is in Recommended stage. The RFC predates the
RFC template and "how we teach this."

### Ember data docs (5 min)

Reviewers welcome for some exciting new Ember Data RFCs!
These are big changes so set aside some time to ponder.

new cache design: https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/854
new request flow: https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/860

We are at the point where we can really benefit from splitting Ember Data
docs into their own resource. runspired is interested in moving that forward
and JW will do some pair programming to advance that.

The version selector in the Guides doesn't really work for how releases
have been going, since we are not in lockstep.

JW did a successful prototype as a standalone, had trouble with the monorepo.
This will be solved once the guides release is done.

CM will write down the broad strokes of a migrations strategy for breaking
guides out into their own resources.

JG Does the TypeScript effort overlap?

Kinda, but we need that for everything. Ember Data can use multiple code blocks
as a stopgap.

JG Do we need to address the people who are doing on TS conversions?

JW will as Thao about the Ember Data TS plans

CM These steps below are the kind of changes we talked about for the
tutorial changes, and may be helpful for Ember Data:

- leave the old version of the tutorial in place (no changes)
- leave the tutorial in the left navigation bar but have it direct to https://tutorials.emberjs.com/
- potentially have a navigation link in https://tutorials.emberjs.com/ back to the main guides (not decided upon yet)
- add a redirect for https://guides.emberjs.com/release/tutorial/part-1/ to the equivalent page in the new website i.e. https://tutorials.emberjs.com/super-rentals/part-1/

As an aside, these steps were for an unversioned resource

### RFCs (5min)

This has updates! https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/831

### EmberConf (2min)

JG will check for updates

### Linting help in Discord chat

Look at dev-ember-learning channel on Discord, help if you can

Could we use a prepare script for running linters, so contributors do not
need to learn these details.

Could also improve the output for the spellcheck linter.

### Tutorials (future topic)

At Ember.js Dublin, it came up that there is a need for more steps
to get from junior Ember developer to intermediate. We had talked about
doing more proliferation of tutorials.

Need to talk about strategy, what kind of tutorials

### Embroider Roadmap (future topic)

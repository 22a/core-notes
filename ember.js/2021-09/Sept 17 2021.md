- (public) (10 min) 4.0 (KG)
- (public) (5-10min) how many addons will need to do a separate/new addon for embroider? see [https://github.com/ivanvotti/ember-svg-jar/pull/192#issuecomment-921033563](https://github.com/ivanvotti/ember-svg-jar/pull/192#issuecomment-921033563) (MS)
    - addons that do packaging-related things will need a new version because we just won't have to do the things we used to have to do.

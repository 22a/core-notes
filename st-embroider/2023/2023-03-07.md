## Topics

### First discord call

- some issues at first
- permission to unmute not available for SI or A 
- PS changed something and it worked
- SI having some audio issues
- PS changed permissions so community members can talk
- more technical difficulties and we got it done ðŸŽ‰
- Note: people should make sure that they don't have "push to talk" turned on if they want to talk

### <5 mins> Can I have release permission please? :) <@mansona>
I plus 1 Manson getting release permissions <@kiwiupover> 
This would be helpful for Intercom to test their app <@achambers>

- the auto release main functionality is merged ðŸŽ‰

### Clarify what the blocker is on https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1364 <@mansona>
Do we need to babysit the first release after merge? Or do we want someone to do it locally to test it out before merging?

- EF this has been merged
- EF: warning that this is very unstable so you shouldn't do this
- CM: yes that's fine. I need it for a side-by-side build
- EF: there are some breaking changes still on main and we need to decide if we want them to be breaking or if we want to do extra work to make it backward-compatible
- blueprint tests for helper tests are using the ambiguous use of a helper in the template
- not awesome
- update the blueprint to make it not ambiguous
- alternatively we can assume a helper or component since Ember 4
- essentially we would use import paths that have `embroider-import/ambiguous/....` etc.
- CM: is this part of the "blockers on main"
- EF: not quite a blocker
- EF: if you come across this issue in an addon there is a possibility to add a package rule that disambiguates the call site
- (discussion about a specific issue with helper invocation)
- EF: we should update the lint rule for ambiguous invocation to suggest wrapping helpers in () instead of adding to whitelist

### Impossible to nest v2 addons with addon shim https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/1325 <@mansona>

https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/blob/main/packages/addon-shim/src/index.ts#L72 is the only time that autoImportInstance is assigned and that wonâ€™t work for nested v2 addons

- EF: merged
- EF: open PR on ember-auto-import that will start passing when we get a stable on embroider PR #571 on ember-auto-import for regression
- https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import/pull/571



### clarify services DI and resolution (and interactions with engines and addons)<@void_mAlex>:
Given a structure similar to:

sharedAddon
  -addon
	-services
  	  shared
  -app
	-services
  	  shared

projectXengine/addon -depends on sharedAddon
  -addon
	-components
  	  comp1 (injects @service internalService AND @service shared)
	-services
  	  internalService
  -app
	-components
  	  comp1 <- component re-export
	-services

consumer -depends on sharedAddon and projectXengine/addon
  -app
	-components
  	  widget <- uses comp1 from projectXengine/addon
	-services
  -tests
	-integration
  	  -components
    	    widget <- error from missing service

- V1 addon internal service staticAddonTrees = true
  - Legacy build forces re-export of all services and given a naming collision in host and addon it would prefer lower service embroider seems to take the host
  - Q: should internally used service be re-exported? Guessing the answer will be yes as without re-export under embroider it fails to find the service
- V1 engine same as above - is there a difference from a plain addon and should users expect there to be one; does embroider do anything special for engines
- Currently DI seems broken if consumer app injects the shared service from the addon and the engine/addon also injects it, they get different instances; not sure if that is intended behaviour or not
- Expected behaviour when a service injects another service and that service is passed to an engine should engine have access to the injected service?

- EF: we need to codify the old behaviour, not a lot of this was speced out
- the best thing that you can do is to create a reproduction for situations that concern you - potentially in the engines test - `embroider/tests/scenarios/engines-test`
- A: you can have a situation where you get a new instance of a service in an addon vs the consuming app
- EF: you're right that this is relevant to the current work on resolver rules
- A: when you have name clashes of services (api service in the engine and consumer app with api service)
- it seems that in embroider you will always inject the consumer's api service when the engine requests it.
- if you want an internal service to an engine are you expected to export it? 
- is it a limitation of the DI system that you can't have isolated services
- EF: my understanding is that engines use nested containers
- let's get clear what the classic behaviour is and reflect it in the tests
- we're at the point where we shouldn't be recommending engines (probably)
- there are better ways to isolate developers from each other
- we might need a better implementation for service injection
- it doesn't support typescript all that well
- it complicates the issue of issolating services too - everything is currently global
- did PS draft a RFC to do this without engines? 
- PS: yes, but there was a bit of a discussion and there were still some issues that needed work
- https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/502
- Godfrey Chan also did some investigation on this too
- https://github.com/tildeio/ember-swappable-service
- EF: we might not need this for everyone, i.e. we don't need to complicate services for the general user
- PS: Yehuda mentioned that he wants services to be resources that just aren't torn down until the app is torn down
- EF: yes that's reasonable - it makes it less complex
- you could achieve this in userland with resources right now
- this is all separate to getting compatibility for what is working now
- A: I will work on implementing a reproduction of the weird things 


###Â  Discuss messaging around ensure-safe-component (tl;dr: you almost never need it and people overuse it) - ef4

- EF: you need to think about what it does and not just sprinkle it over your code to make your warnings go away
- if you don't support before ember 3.25 you don't need this
- CM: can we make it warn like some of the polyfill
- SI: i have used it recently and don't have a way forward to remove it
- I have contextual components that I don't want to make public and I want to curry using the component helper
- https://github.com/CrowdStrike/ember-headless-form/blob/main/packages/ember-headless-form/src/components/headless-form.hbs#L18
- EF: we could provide a "currying only helper" that doesn't accept a string
- the idea is that we shouldn't allow the use of a string
- (general excitement over using gjs to solve this issue)
- EF: you can't pass strings to the component helper in template strict mode - and all gjs are strict mode

tangent on gjs and what it takes to land it as recommended

- https://github.com/ef4/babel-parser-experiment
- EF: I don't think it will be too hard to maintain a parser extension
- unfortunately there isn't a useful plugin system
- A: what about when we don't use bable? esbuild etc? 
- EF: for gjs we would standardise on the AST representation i.e. building the ES tree
- 


### status/path forward wrt https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import/issues/504 - simonihmig

- EF: we need to do the right solution here to have the correct inputs to the AMD modules
- we would need to read from the webpack build
- the best way forward is to pair with EF we just need a volunteer

### https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/1338#issuecomment-1453524143 - simonihmig

- SI: i got trolled by this again
- I'm more interested in giving the end user a better error
- is this relevant to the refactor that is happening on main
- EF: yes

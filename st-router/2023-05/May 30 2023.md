## Notes

### Demo

Showed a demo exploring the idea of stacked routes
Key is the path that will be in the browser URL
More verbose/explicit
For each route, the user defines the template, loading/error functions, and the data

Question: should our router be tied to the resolver like it is today?
Question: should the resolver even exist in future Ember?

We want to being able to parallelize template and data loading by knowing the graph up front

Note: didn't make it to discussing Sveltekit, so that will be pushed to next week.

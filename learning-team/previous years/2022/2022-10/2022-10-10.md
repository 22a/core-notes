 ## Topics

 ### Website redesign 👩🏼‍💻
 JG did not have time and CM does not have time so AG and Nick Schot will work on it together this week.

 ### API docs broken 🥒
 AG talked JW about pairing together, and she was into it, but we did not manage to set a date yet. Feels urgent, but also complex to fix. To CM it does not feel like a runaway index, it does feel like an application issue. JG will look into the fact that the version might be missing in the index. 
 CM: With the complicated deployment pipeline there could be a lot going wrong.
    1. The thing that pulls the docs from the emberjs version 
    2. The thing that converts that into JSON objects
    3. The thing that uploads it to S3
    4. Fastify cache might bug between consumer and S3
    5. There could be something wrong with the app itself, but unlikely because the latest merge was end of July.

 ### Release week 🗓
 JG will be in charge of this 🥳

 ### Release the Times 🗞
 JG will release the Times this week. RFCs in Final Comment Period can be included if they are still relevant. AG will keep writing blurbs this week.

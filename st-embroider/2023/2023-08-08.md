## Topics

### document packages that are obsolete/redundant under embroider https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/1549 <@mansona on behalf of @void-mAlex>

- A: I've been upgrading things in our app and a few things have been getting in the way
- I don't know if we need broccoli-asset-rev
- CM: talking about this makes me think of `ember new --embroider` doesn't do what I was expecting
- I feel like these things could be discussed individually on a single PR (maybe to the blueprint?)
- KG: the blueprint update will help most people once it becomes the default in ember-cli
- A: we could add a compat adapter for unused addons that warns and points to the docs

### what is the plan for prettier support? This is related to the blueprint change blocked on lint failing: https://github.com/embroider-build/addon-blueprint/pull/159 <@mansona>

- (discussion of the current status)
- PS: I'm resuming a pr that deals with this
- I'm working on having a plugin-specific prettier config that you can then add gjs support to in your PR
- https://github.com/embroider-build/addon-blueprint/pull/138
- CM: do we have a way forward for prettier in gjs?
- PS: yes! use this plugin: https://github.com/gitKrystan/prettier-plugin-ember-template-tag

### should we move scenario-tester to embroider-build? Or give some of the tooling team access? This is so that we can review and merge changes like https://github.com/ef4/scenario-tester/pull/14 <@mansona>

### what‚Äôs the situation with ember-cli-mirage? Release the current alpha <@mansona>

- A: alpha for ember-cli-mirage has been out for a year
- you can't use anything but the alpha under embroider
- we need to release it
- PS: the main maintainer pinged the person that does the release
- KG: if we need it we can get hold of other collaborators we can if they don't get back to us
- CM: what about an upgrade guide? it looks like the placeholder hasn't been filled out yet https://github.com/miragejs/ember-cli-mirage/issues/2453
- I'll try to get a PR ready for that

### ember inspector integration for full static embroider; reliance on amd loader to enable functionality <@void-mAlex>

reference: https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/1575

- A: I'm concerned that there isn't enough metadata available for ember inspector
- CM: the person working on ember-inspector will have more time at the end of August
- KG: RFCs won't be able to move into recommended until the dev tools are supported
- CM: so the process is making sure things won't get lost üéâ

### ember-engines increase bus factor <@void-mAlex>

- A: I have recently gotten a PR merged that I want to get released but everyone who can release is on holiday üèùÔ∏è
- KG: I can ping Rob and get access
- we can then set up automated release via CI
- CM: I feel like the "tooling team" should be able to merge and release this since we expect the surface area to get smaller as embroider takes over more of the work that engines used to do
- KG: I would caution trying to take responsibility for too much of the ecosystem 
- CM: üëç

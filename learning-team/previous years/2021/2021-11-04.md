### Hacktoberfest wrap up

- It was a light year on purpose. No churn to deal with.
- Good practice to ask people to help with addons
- Minimal spam this year

### Sharing secrets within the team (RM)

We don't have a good way to share secrets like env vars. The release tool
was using heroku for something and RM needed a place to put the secrets.

What's our strategy?

1Password has a plan for OSS teams.
We can ask the other teams what they are using.

locks will chat with the other teams to see if we can be added.

GitHub - scripting something to get a value is very hard to do.

CM: but if we're just using these values in scripts shouldn't we keep them in something like github and run the scripts in github actions

RM: confustion

CM: wait, we want to both be able to access (and view) the secrets **and** be able to run scripts using them. And if we used something like 1Password we would be using their API in the tool to access the right valut to get the secret. I get it now ðŸ™ˆ

RM: should we use hashicorp vault? 

CM: I've used vault before but it seems less useful than 1Password for what we need (very kubernetes'y). Maybe we just go with 1Password

RM: sounds good

@thelocks will look into this (and is adding the action item himself)

## Topics

<!-- If you would like to add a topic to the agenda please add a suggestion to the PR using the following format: -->
<!-- ### Your topic (INITIALS, expected duration in minutes) -->

<5 mins> Standing agenda item: Who is working on what tasks and do you need help with context? (generate agenda items, don’t use this time to discuss)
### Add @ember/owner to virtual modules <@NullVoxPopuli>
Blocked because ember-cli 5 dropped node 14, so tests are incompat (just needs rebase (test rebase here), 'cause main is fixed)

- looks good LGTM

### Enable prettier in CI <@NullVoxPopuli>

- strange changes
- let's not change hbs single quote to 

### How do we want to handle maintaining the changelog? Sync PR - last updated mid Feb <@NullVoxPopuli>

- PS: the recommended way to use changeset is to have a changeset in a PR
- we should be adding changesets as we add PRs
- CM: we discussed this before and we agreed that we need to do changelog work in the "release phase" not in the merge phase
- we should find a way to continue to do this
- PS: I created a tool that goes through merged PRs and creates

(discussion in general about the tooling)

- we need to make sure that the generated changelog has a link back to the PR (not just the title)
- we should add this automation stuff to the package.json so we can run `pnpm recover-changset` (and not have to specify a commit if we don't need/want to)

### Are there any docs on the changes involved in the inversion-of-control refactor? <@22a>

- general discussion
- linked to https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1375 and https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1374 as blockers to the inversion of control
- general context is that there was a massive performance regression with webpack 5 when not using the webpack dev server

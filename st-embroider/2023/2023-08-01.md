## Topics

### Check if we have released ember-cli-test-loader <@mansona>

- released to npm but not a github release
- manually add a github release

### @embroider/app-blueprint? (Polaris, preprepreview?) <@NullVoxPopuli>

- PS: is it too early?
- EF: it should start with vite - I'm waiting for that

### document packages that are obsolete/redundant under embroider https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/1549 <@mansona on behalf of @void-mAlex>

- CM: added for Alex - not here, should talk about it next week
- EF: in general there is no divergence between blueprints right now
- in general we shouldn't have things in the blueprint that are archived

### scenario-tester: add TypeDoc documentation and a guide, brush up code <@lolmaus>

- (overview)
- EF: a lot of the project comes through from fixtureify project
- we should consider that we maintain this too
- AM: I would like to rename some things too
- EF: seems good - in separate PRs

### auto deploy PR: https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1565 <@mansona>

- let's merge it

### questions on the ember-template-imports issue https://github.com/ember-template-imports/ember-template-imports/issues/143 <@achambers>

- (review comment)
- EF: I think you're right about all the things that you need to update here
- AC: I'll try to pick this up this week


### aligning on goals, why cross-compile? <@NullVoxPopuli>
  - related https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1564

- (discussion)
- essentially we need to still be able to import embroider things in ember-cli-build

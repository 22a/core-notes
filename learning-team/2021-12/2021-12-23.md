## Weekly review

## Topics

### https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/issues/1762

- confirmed we can repro
- history does have correct url
- the url that causes the 404 does seem to be broken (it's not the same as in other versions where the url works)
- it might be an issue with a regex that's happening somewhere
- might need to investigate in guidemaker and check how the request is being made

### browser-support page update

- browser support page isn't yet updated
- there's a limited PR up now that doesn't include references to 3.0
- we probably want to add something at the bottom of the page that does include 3.0
- JG will update his PR

### other open items from 4.0 epic

- RM audits need an issue covering them, JG is going to open
- RM will take `Need to assert ember-modifiers is compatible with 4.0`
- JG We'll also open an issue re promises at the async routing page in the guides and tag mixonic

### misc / future discussion points

- RM need to discuss as a team what a release is (blog post, ember-source, etc)
- RM we probably think of it as the blog post, but we don't communicate this anywhere
- RM The wiki page indicates the released version of the library
- RM If we want to change this we'll need to communicate it
- RM When going through the release process the API docs built every version and we thought someone had done work to prevent that
- RM We were holding off on moving to a Github Project, but if we can fix w/ low effort then we should probably just do that

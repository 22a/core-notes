<!-- ### Your topic (INITIALS, expected duration in minutes) -->

### Contribution resources for intermediates (AG, 10mins)

- CM: ember help wanted no issues ðŸ™ˆ
- AG: is it actually broken or are there no issues with help wanted
- CM: I can take a look at fixing the app
- I can also look into adding an "all issues" button
- AG: I looked around a few repos and there didn't seem to be anything that wasn't super complicated
- CM: maybe we need to populate our repos with issues asking for help
- JW: last time the help wanted app broke it was because of an expired token
- things that people can do to help: updating our ember apps to latest versions
- also invite people to create issues for updates or things they want to work on


### Ember API docs proposed changes (JW, 5mins)

- https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-api-docs/pull/856
- (aside about context around ember-api-docs)
- JW: a lot of this code was written a long time ago by someone else, nobody has much context
- feel encouraged to change things even if you don't fully understand
- if a change seems ok and it seems to work when testing manually then we can just merge
- (/aside)
- CM: can we preview this? 
- JW: yes! I'll do that now and we can review it together

(coming back to this)

- can't be a H1
- we like the visual hierarcy
- problem with "public" packages https://ember-api-docs-review-template.herokuapp.com/ember/release/modules/@ember%2Fdestroyable
- fix the color contrast https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/?fcolor=B67D47&bcolor=EAEAEA
- JW: I will reply


### Guides redesign - blockers for Ember upgrade (CM, 5mins)

- CM: some things in adopted-ember-addons/ember-collapsible-panel need to be merged
- we also have an issue going forward because ember-data@4.12 is not compatible with fastboot
- as i was upgrading the guidemaker-ember-template for 4.12 and got hit with this: 
- https://github.com/ember-fastboot/ember-cli-fastboot/issues/913

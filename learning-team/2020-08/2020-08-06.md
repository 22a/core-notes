<!-- ### Your topic (INITIALS, expected duration in minutes) -->
### Concretize making PRs for 2 Ember Guides issues (IL, 15-20 min)

IL - I think these feature requests will help in welcoming new visitors to the site. They do involve changing multiple files, possibly across multiple versions, so I'd like us to discuss how to divide the work involved so that each PR can be of reasonable size for review.

- [Replace "First" and "Last" name code examples](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/issues/1480)
- [Fix API links in the Guides that go to "release"](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/issues/1440)

## Topics

<!-- If you would like to add a topic to the agenda please add a suggestion to the PR using the following format: -->
<!-- ### Your topic (INITIALS, expected duration in minutes) -->

### css-loader default options appear to not be set to default, breaking CSS imports (like `@import 'some-file.css' inside of `app.css`. Is this intended? <@nickschot>

- created a new app with embroider enabled
- `@import` a css file in app.css
- didn't work
- css-loader default config should have this enabled
- CM: there are some default webpack configs that are different in dev and production
- A: app.css doesn't go through the same path
- i recommend not using app.css, create another anywhere other than the styles folder and import that from somewhere
- (a bit of discussion to see what the issue is in embroider)
- related issue: https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/1486 app.css is a required file


### can we close https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/19099 and https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/501 ? Might want to point people to something else like the project board? <@mansona>

- A: I think we can close both of these and point people at the github project
- CM: the meta issue will be replaced with the PR tracking issues (for stages) when the v2 app spec PR is created 
- I also think we can close both

### we have new dependency resolution problems in app re-exports from a v2 addon, requiring people to set things as a peer dep and then add to your app. While it‚Äôs correct do we think we can solve this by ‚Äúknowing‚Äù we are in an app re-export and resolve from that context? E.g. ember-tether <@mansona>

- (discussion of the problem)
- CM: just checking that it does indeed seem like a problem
- CM: I'll create an issue and we should fix it 

### Typescript bad assumption https://github.com/typed-ember/ember-cli-typescript/blob/master/ts/addon.ts#L69-L84 running `npm start` on v2 addon and also running a build in an ember app <@mansona>

- maybe it needs to be deprecated!?
- PM: we removed ember-cli-typescript from our app and rely on babel 
- CM: looks like it's not in a new app with the typescript cli option
- PM: maybe we can ask the typescript team about this and get their opinion
- in ember-cli-babel config you can `enableTypeScriptTransform: true,` 
- CM: I'll ask the TS team


### What are our thoughts of adding tests to individual packages of the monorepo? While it‚Äôs good to have scenario-tester end-to-end tests it could be nice to do some things in mocha like the rollup plugin <@mansona>

- will discuss next week because of üéâüá∫üá∏

## Topics

### Deprecated APIs in guides-source (rajakvk)
Issue: https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/issues/1711

RM: my suggestion given the time sensitivity is I can take over, so we don't put the pressure on contributors.

### Wikipedia updates (rajakvk)
https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User_talk:Konstin "Github-wiki-bot inactive?"

### Releases page (RM, 10min)
https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-website/pull/878

RM+CM: we can do a github action to commit the entire release history (`npm info ember-source time`) to the repo and then use that
RM+CM: another modification would be to only show the released betas so as not to imply that the cycle is mandates by betas or whatever.
CM: I want to imply that there could be a new beta by having a greyed out one, so people don't think the next release is the stable one.

### Website redesign (CM, 1min)

CM: We've restarted the website redesign strike team
CM: The meeting is right after the learning team one
CM: help wanted!

### 1Password for Teams (RM, 5min)

RM: we are mostly set up. some members are still not invited
RM: I have been updating tool-new-release to use it. `glitch.app` is done, I'm still working on `ember-api-docs`.

### Ember 4.0 (rajakvk, 5min)

Release blog post: https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-blog/pull/1036
